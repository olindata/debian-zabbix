IPv6 confusion
--------------

 The Zabbix packages in Debian are IPv6-enabled. Please be aware that if
 you are just using IPv4 then you may need to specify your IP addresses
 in the /etc/zabbix/zabbix-agentd.conf in IPv6 syntax, too. Example:

 Server=10.20.30.40,::ffff:10.20.30.40

        ^---- IPv4    ^---- IPv6

agent versus agentd
-------------------

 There are two ways to run a Zabbix agent:

 a) zabbix-agentd (daemon process)

    This is the common way to use the agent. A zabbix_agentd daemon process
    is started by an init.d script and is running permanently. The
    configuration file is /etc/zabbix/zabbix-agentd.conf

 b) zabbix-agent (run on demand by your inetd)

    This allows you to run the Zabbix agent on demand without having it
    running permanently on your system. The configuration file for this
    kind of operation is /etc/zabbix/zabbix-agent.conf

    You will have to run the zabbix-agent process from your inet daemon
    (openbsd-inetd or xinetd) by adding this line to your services:

    zabbix_agent stream tcp nowait.3600 zabbix /opt/zabbix/bin/zabbix_agent

    Also add these service definitions to your /etc/services file:

    zabbix_agent 10050/tcp
    zabbix_trap 10051/tcp

    Don't forget to restart your inetd.

    This method is however not recommended and the zabbix-agent binary may in
    the future be removed in favor of the zabbix-agentd. Unless you have a
    reason not to do so you are encouraged to use the agentd.
