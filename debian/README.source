This package uses 'dpatch' to add patches. See
/usr/share/doc/dpatch/README.source.gz on how this works.

Currently we use it to avoid building with libssl. The libssl
license is not GPL compatible and thus linking against it is
a GPL violation.

Todos:
- ucf complains about not using "--debconf-ok"
- use the font from the appropriate Debian package
- refactor debian/rules
