Things to fix in the Debian package:

- Zabbix server packages install both /usr/share/zabbix (for dbconfig-common
  SQL) and /usr/share/zabbix-(my|pg)sql. Move it both to the latter place.

- For proxy packages only an empty database has to be created. The step
  of sending SQL into it can be spared. The Zabbix proxy process handles
  that.
