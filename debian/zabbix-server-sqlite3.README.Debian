ZABBIX server for Debian
-------------------------

 This zabbix-server-sqlite3 package will offer to create the database
 automatically during the installation. If you chose to do this step
 manually then please find the SQL scripts in /usr/share/zabbix-server.
 Please configure the database access in the /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf
 so that Zabbix knows where to find the database.
